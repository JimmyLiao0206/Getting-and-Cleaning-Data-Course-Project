This code book summarizes all the variables and calculated summaries in "FinalData".

Data to variables:
features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
The data for "features" come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
"activities" performed when the measurements that matched were taken
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
The observed test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects 
x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
features of test data
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
test data of activities’ code labels
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
observed train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects 
x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
features of train data
y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
train data of activities’ code labels

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set:
X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is made by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is made by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is made by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
Merged_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:
TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, which selects only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:
Entire numbers in code column of the TidyData is replaced with matched activity taken from second column of the activities variable

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names:
code column in TidyData renamed into activities
Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject: 
FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData by taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file.
